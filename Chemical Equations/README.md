## Molecule Builder Project Overview
Molecule Builder is a browser-based tool that allows users to assemble atoms into molecular structures visually. Users can select atoms like hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and connect them to build molecules. 
The app provides visual feedback and updates in real time as users create or modify their models.
This project combines logic-driven state management with a smooth interactive experience.

## Functions
Users can individually select atoms and bonds to drop on the reaction zone. Users can remove each dropped item or clear the reaction zone on the "Clear" button.  

## Feature
- Drag and drop atoms to the canvas to construct molecules
- Visual indicators for atom type and bond capacity
- Responsive layout for desktops and tablets
- Reset and rebuild structures easily
- Lightweight and fast-loading with optimized builds
- Multiple Language support

## Built With
- React – Component-based architecture
- React DnD – Enables intuitive drag-and-drop atom placement
- Netlify – Instant deployment and CI/CD workflow
